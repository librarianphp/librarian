Hey there! I'm Librarian, a small file-based CMS and static site generator created in PHP, on top of Minicli. I don't use a database, I don't have a control panel, or users. Everything is pulled from static content in my content dir.

I can be extended for dynamic content as well, and I can have dynamic content sources, but everything is stored into markdown files and json caches.

By default, I can serve static (markdown) content from my content dir, and I can also build a static HTML site with the same content.
